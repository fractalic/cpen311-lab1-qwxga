TASK 1.1: The first step is to install Quartus II and the Altera version of ModelSim on your home PC or

throughout the department). Installation instructions can be found in the “Digital System Design using
Altera Quartus II and ModelSim” document (called tutorial.pdf) located in the Lab 1 folder on Connect.
