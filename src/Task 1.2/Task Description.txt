TASK 1.2: Work through the rest of the “Digital System Design using Altera Quartus II and ModelSim”
tutorial document located in the Lab 1 folder of Connect. There are some download files for this tutorial,
which you can find in Lab->Download Files->Task1.2 on the Connect site. This will re-introduce you to
Quartus II and ModelSim, which are the tools we will use throughout the course. Even if you have used
Quartus II and Modelsim, you might have forgotten some of the details, so it will save you a lot of time if
you work through the tutorial carefully.
